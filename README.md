Access to James Sanua's journal publications and his extensive oeuvre has hitherto been difficult. Therefore, the journalistic and artistic material of the Paris-exiled Egyptian nationalist has hardly received the degree of scholarly attention it actually deserves. Nevertheless, during the research-work for her Ph.D. dissertation [The Construct of Egypt's National-Self in James Sanua's Early Satire and Caricature](https://www.degruyter.com/view/title/566623) Eliane Ursula Ettmueller was able to collect James Sanua's complete works and –even more importantly– the majority of the originals of his magazines. Mrs Eva Milhaud kindly gave her the permission to have Sanua's legacy digitized and to make it available to interested readers and researchers all over the world. As the newspaper-series of the period from August 1878 to December 1884 and of the ones published between 1908 and 1910 were not among the originals, Prof. Dr. Nagwa Anous made it possible for her to have the reprints scanned which were published by Dar Sader in Beirut in 1974.

Publication records are provided in MODS XML and include the publication title in Arabic, western transcription, and English or French translation (using the Translation on the originals, if available). In addition, the date of each issue in Arabic and western notation, as well as issue number and number of pages are provided. The scans were produced in tiff format at 300 ppi, 8bit. They can be found in [The Abou Naddara Collection](http://abou-naddara.uni-hd.de) or in the [Abou Naddara Newspaper Collection](https://abou-naddara.freizo.org/).
